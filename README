Sample use of an android project skeleton

Used for priceswagger, and basic init for json processing and rest

This public source goes as far as receiving the JSON data, and returning back to the PriceSwaggerActivity class, but does not
perform any behavior with this data. It is useful for a basic android application structure, reference or a basic starting point

on an Android platform.
